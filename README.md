## Decodon

An opinionated fork of mastodon with the following modifications:

* All accounts are locked/private, meaning content is only distributed to followers [jesseplusplus/decodon#1](https://github.com/jesseplusplus/decodon/pull/1)

* Support for push notifications to Expo-based apps [jesseplusplus/decodon#2](https://github.com/jesseplusplus/decodon/pull/2)

* Pre-signed URLs for extra-secure storage of uploaded private media [jesseplusplus/decodon#9](https://github.com/jesseplusplus/decodon/pull/9)

* replies are treated more like comments and are filtered from the home feed [jesseplusplus/decodon#3](https://github.com/jesseplusplus/decodon/pull/3)

* circles (lists of followers you can address posts to instead of only followers) - cherry-picked from [fedibird](https://github.com/fedibird/fedibird) - [jesseplusplus/decodon#13](https://github.com/jesseplusplus/decodon/pull/13)

* default "inner circle" for all accounts to get them started - [jesseplusplus/decodon#14](https://github.com/jesseplusplus/decodon/pull/14)

* more control over logo and branding in email templates [jesseplusplus/decodon#10](https://github.com/jesseplusplus/decodon/pull/10)

* updated heroku deployment configs
